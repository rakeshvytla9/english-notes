# Subject-Verb Agreement - Class 03

## **TYPE-14: Concept of Percent**

**Rule:** In the case of "percent," the verb is determined by the **noun** that comes after the preposition "of".
*   If the noun is Plural $\rightarrow$ Verb is **Plural**.
*   If the noun is Uncountable $\rightarrow$ Verb is **Singular**.
*   If the noun is Singular $\rightarrow$ Verb is **Singular**.

### **Visual Method (The Logic):**
*   **Plural Noun:** If you take a percentage (slice) out of a plural group, the slice is still plural.
*   **Uncountable Noun:** If you take a percentage out of an uncountable substance (like water), the slice is still uncountable.
*   **Singular Noun:** If you take a percentage out of a single item (like one apple), the slice is part of a singular object.

### **Handwritten Board Examples:**
1.  **Ten percent** of the **students** (Plural) **have** passed the exam.
    *   *Reason:* "Students" is plural $\rightarrow$ Plural Verb.
2.  **Ten percent** of **water** (Uncountable) **has** been used.
    *   *Reason:* "Water" is uncountable $\rightarrow$ Singular Verb.
3.  **Three percent** of **this apple** (Singular) **is** rotten.
    *   *Reason:* "This apple" refers to one single apple $\rightarrow$ Singular Verb.
4.  **Three percent** of **these apples** (Plural) **are** rotten.
    *   *Reason:* "These apples" refers to multiple apples $\rightarrow$ Plural Verb.

### **Slide Examples:**
1.  Twenty percent of **students** in this class **are** girls.
2.  Twenty one percent of the **air** **is** oxygen. *(Air is uncountable)*
3.  Two percent of **this apple** **is** rotten. *(This apple is singular)*

## **TYPE-16: Concept of Ratio / Fractions**

**Rule:** The logic for fractions (1/3, 2/3, 3/4) is exactly the same as for percentages. The noun following "of" determines the verb.

*   **1/3 (One-third)**
*   **2/3 (Two-thirds)**
*   **1/4 (One-fourth)**
*   **3/4 (Three-fourths)**

### **Slide Examples:**
1.  **Two-thirds** of the **book** (Singular) **is** not useful to read.
2.  **Three-fourths** of **this mango** (Singular) **is** rotten.
3.  **One-third** of the **boys** (Plural) in this class **have** performed well.
4.  **Two-thirds** of the **milk** (Uncountable) you kept **has** been drunk by me.
5.  **One-fifth** of the **water** (Uncountable) in Delhi **is** available to drink.
6.  **Three-fourths** of the **men** (Plural) **have** gone to war. *(Note: MEN is plural, MAN is singular)*.

---

## **TYPE-13: Indefinite Pronouns (Person)**

**Words:** Everybody, Somebody, Nobody, Anybody, Everyone, Someone, No one, Anyone.

**Rule:**
1.  These are always considered **Singular subjects**.
2.  They take a **Singular Verb**.
3.  The possessive adjective used for them is **HIS** (or *Her*), but **never** *Their* or *Its*.

**Structure:**
> Indefinite Pronoun + **Singular Verb** + ... **his** ...

### **Examples:**
1.  **Everyone** **has** reached in the party.
2.  **Nobody** in the class **has** completed **his** work. *(Note: Using 'their' here is a common error)*.
3.  **Somebody** **has** stolen my watch.

---

## **TYPE (Concept Continuation): Indefinite Pronouns (Thing)**

**Words:** Everything, Something, Nothing, Anything.

**Rule:**
1.  These represent non-living things.
2.  They take a **Singular Verb**.
3.  The possessive adjective used for them is **ITS**.

**Structure:**
> Indefinite Pronoun + **Singular Verb** + ... **its** ...

### **Examples:**
4.  **Everything** **has** **its** own importance.
5.  **Nothing** **attracts** me except a clear conscience. *(Note: 'Attracts' is the singular form of the verb)*.

---

## **TYPE-26: Quantifiers (Most of, Some of, etc.)**

**Words:** Most of, Some of, Half of, Enough of, Not enough of, Plenty of, A lot of, Lots of, A great deal of, A variety of.

**Rule:** Look at the noun following these quantifiers (similar to Percent/Fraction logic).
*   **Case A:** + Uncountable Noun $\rightarrow$ **Singular Verb**.
*   **Case B:** + Plural Countable Noun $\rightarrow$ **Plural Verb**.

### **Examples (Uncountable):**
1.  **Most of** the **knowledge** **is** gained by experience.
2.  **Half of** the **milk** **has** been spoiled. (Example given orally)
3.  **A lot of** **money** **has** been given to Andhra Pradesh and Bihar.

### **Examples (Plural):**
1.  **Most of** the **girls** **are** absent today.
2.  **Half of** the **candidates** **have** passed with flying colours.
3.  **Some of** the **students** **have** not taken the exam.
4.  **A lot of** **guests** **were** attended upon by the host.
5.  **Plenty of** **books** **were** donated to the library by him.

### **Type 17: "A lot of" vs "Lots of"**
Both have the same meaning (A large amount/number).
*   Correct: **A lot of** (singular 'a', singular 'lot')
*   Correct: **Lots of** (no 'a', plural 'lots')
*   *Incorrect:* A lots of (This is a common error).

**Example:**
*   **Lots of** boys **want** to go in armed forces.

**Structure:**
> **A / An + Group Word + of + Plural Noun + Singular Verb**

**Group Words:** Flock, bundle, bunch, galaxy, crowd, class, batch, gang, set, fleet, team, etc.

### **Examples:**
1.  **Each** mother and **each** father **was** recognised at the meeting.
2.  **Each** boy and **every** girl **has** reached the institute.

---
