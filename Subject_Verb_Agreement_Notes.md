## 📌 Core Concept
The verb must agree with the **main subject** of the sentence in number (Singular/Plural) and person. It must **not** agree with objects or other nouns near the verb.

## 1. The Basic Rule & The "Preposition Trap"
* **Rule:** Singular Subject → Singular Verb | Plural Subject → Plural Verb.
* **The Trap:** Prepositions (*of, in, at, on*) are followed by **objects**, not subjects. 
    * **Tip:** Mentally cross out prepositional phrases to find the real subject.

**Examples:**
* ❌ *The quality of apples are good.* (Incorrect - 'apples' is the object of 'of')
* ✅ *The **quality** [of apples] **is** good.* (Correct - 'quality' is the singular subject)
* ✅ *The **consequences** [of the decision] **were** serious.* ('Consequences' is plural)

---

## 2. Gerunds as Subjects
* **Rule:** When a verb ending in `-ing` (Gerund) acts as the subject, it is always **Singular**.

**Examples:**
* ✅ ***Smoking** **is** injurious to health.*
* ✅ ***Reading** books **is** my hobby.* (Subject is the act of 'Reading', not 'books')

---

## 3. Inversion (Subject after Verb)
* **Rule:** In sentences starting with "Here", "There", or location phrases, the subject often comes *after* the verb. Find the subject to determine the verb.

**Examples:**
* ✅ *There **was** a **boy** in the class.*
* ✅ *There **were** some **boys** in the class.*
* ✅ *Along the northern frontier **are** the **Himalayas**.* (Subject is 'Himalayas')

---

## 4. The "AND" Rules
### General Rule
* **Noun + AND + Noun = Plural**
* *Example:* Ram **and** Shyam **are** coming.

### The "Pair" Exception (Single Idea)
* **Rule:** If two nouns joined by "and" represent a single idea, unit, or person, use a **Singular Verb**.

**Key Pairs:**
| Pair | Concept/Meaning | Verb |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Slow and steady | Perseverance | Wins |
| Bread and butter | Livelihood | Is |
| Horse and carriage | Single vehicle | Is |
| Sum and substance | Summary/Gist | Is |
| Law and order | Administrative state | Is |

## 5. The "More Than One" Confusion
This rule depends on the noun immediately following the phrase.

* **Structure A:** `More than one` + **Singular Noun** + **Singular Verb**
    * ✅ *More than **one student was** absent.*
* **Structure B:** `More than two` + **Plural Noun** + **Plural Verb**
    * ✅ *More than **two thieves have** been caught.*

---

## 6. Many vs. Many A
* **Standard:** `Many` + Plural Noun → **Plural Verb**
    * ✅ *Many **students have** passed.*
* **Exception:** `Many a / Many an` + Singular Noun → **Singular Verb**
    * *Note:* Used in formal English to denote "many such individuals, one by one".
    * ✅ *Many **a student has** passed.*

---

## 7. Much vs. Many
* **Many:** Used for **Countable** nouns → **Plural**.
* **Much:** Used for **Uncountable** nouns (quantity) → **Singular**.

**Examples:**
* ✅ *Much **has** happened since you left.*
* ✅ *Much **milk was** wasted.*
