### **COMPREHENSIVE STUDY NOTES: Subject-Verb Agreement (Class 02)**

#### **TYPE-07: The Concept of "There"**

"There" functions in two ways in a sentence. The verb depends on its usage.

**1. "There" as an Adverb of Place**
*   **Usage:** Used after the verb or at the end of a sentence to indicate a location.
*   **Rule:** It has no effect on the verb agreement.
*   *Example:* Ravi (Sub) **is going** (Verb) **there** (Adverb).

**2. "There" as a Dummy Subject (Inversion)**
*   **Usage:** Used at the *beginning* of a sentence.
*   **Rule:** "There" is a dummy subject. The verb agrees with the **Noun/Pronoun** that appears *after* the verb.
*   **Structure:** `There + Verb + Real Subject (Noun/Pronoun)`

| Real Subject (After Verb) | Verb Required | Example |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Singular Noun** | **Singular Verb** | There **was** a **boy** in the class. |
| **Plural Noun** | **Plural Verb** | There **were many students** waiting. |
| **Uncountable Noun** | **Singular Verb** | There **was** some **water** in the glass. |
| **Singular Concept** | **Singular Verb** | There **has** been a great **slump** (fall) in the economy. |

#### **TYPE-08: "A Number of" vs. "The Number of"**

This rule distinguishes between referring to a multitude vs. a specific statistic.

**A. "A number of..."**
*   **Logic:** Means "Many" (Bahut saare). Focus is on the large quantity.
*   **Rule:** `A number of + Plural Noun + Plural Verb`
*   *Example:* **A number of MNCs are** going to be set up in India.

**B. "The number of..."**
*   **Logic:** Refers to a specific digit or count (Ek sankhya). e.g., The count is 380.
*   **Rule:** `The number of + Plural Noun + Singular Verb`
*   *Example:* **The number of students** in this school **is** increasing. (The *count* is increasing, not the students themselves).

#### **TYPE-09: "One of..." and its Variations (Crucial for Exams)**

This concept has three distinct levels of difficulty.

**Level 1: Basic Rule**
*   **Logic:** Selection of one from many. The subject is "One".
*   **Rule:** `One of + Plural Noun + Singular Verb`
*   *Example 1:* **One** of my bad habits **is** using tobacco.
*   *Example 2:* **One** of the candidates **is** not cut out for (suitable for) this post.

**Level 2: The Relative Pronoun Rule (The "Villain")**
*   **Logic:** When a Relative Pronoun (Who, Which, That) creates a bridge, the verb agrees with the **Antecedent** (the word immediately before Who/Which/That).
*   **Rule:** `...One of + Plural Noun (Antecedent) + Rel. Pronoun + Plural Verb`
*   *Example:* Geeta is one of the **girls** (Ant) **who have** participated.
    *   *Explanation:* Many girls participated. Geeta is one of *them*. The verb agrees with "girls".

**Level 3: The "Only One" Exception**
*   **Logic:** When "The Only" is added, the focus shifts back to the single individual, overriding the relative pronoun rule.
*   **Rule:** `...The ONLY one of + Plural Noun + Rel. Pronoun + Singular Verb`
*   *Example:* Ravi is **the only one** of the students that **has** got 98% marks.
    *   *Explanation:* Only Ravi got 98%, not the other students.

**Bonus Concept: Percentages with Uncountable Nouns**
*   **Rule:** Percentages of Uncountable Nouns remain Uncountable (Singular).
*   *Example:* Twenty-five percent of the **water** (Uncountable) **has** been used.

#### **TYPE-10: Prepositional Connectors**

**The First Subject Rule:**
When two subjects are joined by specific connecting phrases, the verb agrees with the **First Subject**. The second subject is treated as part of a prepositional phrase (extra information).

**🔑 Connector List:**
*   With
*   Along with
*   Together with
*   As well as
*   And not
*   Like / Unlike
*   Besides / In addition to
*   Accompanied by
*   Nothing but
*   Rather than

**Structure:** `Subject 1 + Connector + Subject 2 + Verb (Agrees with S1)`

**Examples:**
1.  The **PM** (S1) along with his colleagues **has** (V) been welcomed.
2.  **Veena** (S1) and not her friends **has** (V) won the prize.
3.  **Silver** (S1) as well as gold **is** (V) considered precious.
4.  The **teacher** (S1) as well as students **has** (V) gone on an excursion.
5.  **Grandfather** (S1) along with children **has** (V) gone to Chennai.
6.  The **leader** (S1) with all his followers **is** (V) sent to prison.

#### **TYPE-12: Deceptive Plurals (Proper Nouns)**

Certain names of books, countries, games, or diseases look plural (end in 's') but are actually **Singular Proper Nouns**. They take a **Singular Verb**.

*   **Books/Novels:**
    *   *The Arabian Nights* **is**...
    *   *Three Idiots* **is**...
    *   *A Tale of Two Cities* **was** written by Charles Dickens.
*   **Games:**
    *   *Billiards* **was** played... (Names of sports are singular).
*   **Countries/Organizations:**
    *   *The United States* **does** not want... (Refers to one country).
