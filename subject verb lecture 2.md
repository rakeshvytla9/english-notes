# **Subject-Verb Agreement – Class 02**
**Course:** SSC Foundation 2025 (Nayak Batch)
**Instructor:** Sanjeev Sir

## **TYPE 07: The Use of "There" (Dummy Subject)**

When a sentence begins with **"There"**, it acts as a **Dummy Subject**. It has no power to decide the verb. The verb is determined by the **Real Subject** that appears *after* the verb.

### **The Rule:**
*   **Structure:** `There + Verb + Real Subject (Noun/Pronoun)`
*   If Real Subject is **Singular** $\rightarrow$ Use **Singular Verb**.
*   If Real Subject is **Plural** $\rightarrow$ Use **Plural Verb**.

### **Note:**
If "there" appears after a verb (e.g., *He went there*), it is an **Adverb of Place**, not a subject.

### **Class Examples (Slides & Handwritten):**
1.  **There were** many students who were toiling a way to join NDA.
    *   *Reason:* 'Many students' (Plural) $\rightarrow$ **were**.
2.  **There has** been a great slump in Indian economy since Covid-19 broke out.
    *   *Reason:* 'A great slump' (Singular) $\rightarrow$ **has**. *(Slump = Decline/Giravat)*
3.  **There was** a boy who brought the house down for his family.
    *   *Reason:* 'A boy' (Singular) $\rightarrow$ **was**.
4.  *(Handwritten)* **There was** some water in the glass.
    *   *Reason:* 'Water' is Uncountable (Singular) $\rightarrow$ **was**.

## **TYPE 08: "A Number of" vs. "The Number of"**

This rule distinguishes between an indefinite quantity (many) and a specific statistic (a number).

| Phrase | Meaning | Verb Agreement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A Number of** | "Many" / "A lot of" (Indefinite) | **Plural Verb** |
| **The Number of** | A specific figure/digit/count (Definite) | **Singular Verb** |

### **Class Examples:**
1.  **A number of** MNCs **are** going to be set up in India soon.
    *   *(Meaning: Many MNCs)*
2.  **The number of** students in this school **is** increasing.
    *   *(Meaning: The count/statistic is increasing)*
3.  **A number of** candidates **have** applied for this post.
    *   *(Meaning: Many candidates)*

### **Handwritten Board Example (Video ~25:20):**
*   **"The number of girls who were(were because it refers to girls not number) in the library was/were very high."**
    *   **Correct Answer:** **was**.
    *   *Logic:* The subject is "The number" (a specific count). The phrase "in the library" is just extra information about location. The count itself is singular.

## **TYPE 09: The "One of" Concepts (The Triangle)**

This section covers three variations of the "One of" rule.

### **Variation A: The Basic "One of"**
Used when selecting one item from a group.
*   **Rule:** `One of + Plural Noun + Singular Verb`
*   **The Picture Method (Habits):** The teacher drew a circle representing "Bad Habits". Inside were many habits (Smoking, Waking late, etc.). He pulled **ONE** habit out (Tobacco). The subject is that single habit, not the whole circle.

**Examples:**
1.  **One of** my bad habits **is** use of tobacco.
2.  **One of** them **has** not complete **his** work.
3.  **One of** the candidates **is** not cut out for this. *(Cut out for = Eligible)*
4.  **One of** the girls **has** not reached **her** home so far.

---

### **Variation B: "One of" + Relative Pronoun**
When "One of" is followed by Who, Which, or That.
*   **Rule:** `One of + Plural Noun (Antecedent) + Relative Pronoun + Plural Verb`
*   **Logic:** The Relative Pronoun refers to the **Antecedent** (the noun immediately before it). Since the antecedent is plural, the verb is plural.

## Examples

1. Geeta is one of the **girls who have** participated in the competition.  
   **Antecedent:** Girls → have

2. She is one of the **best mothers that have** ever lived.  
   **Antecedent:** Mothers → have

3. Ramesh is one of these **honest employees who have** worked in this company till today.  
   **Antecedent:** Employees → have

4. Sikhar Dhawan was one of those **Indian cricketers who were** injured in the World Cup.  
   **Antecedent:** Cricketers → were

5. She is one of the **girls who work** hard day in, day out.  
   **Antecedent:** Girls → work (plural verb, no “s”)
## Concept: The Mixed Example

**Sentence:**  
The number of students who have participated in the essay writing competition is 365.

- **Part 1:** students who **have**  
  Relative pronoun **who** refers to **students** (plural) → **have**

- **Part 2:** The number **is**  
  Main subject **The number** (singular statistic) → **is**
---

### **Variation C: The "Only One" Exception**
When the phrase uses **"The Only"**.
*   **Rule:** `The only one of + Plural Noun + Relative Pronoun + Singular Verb`
*   **Logic:** The word "Only" restricts the meaning to a single entity, overriding the antecedent rule. The focus shifts back to "One".

**Handwritten Examples:**
1.  Ravi is **the only one** of the students **that has** got 98% marks in the Exams.
    *   *Logic:* Only Ravi got the marks, not all the students.
2.  Ankit is **the only one** of the boys **that is** present in the classroom.

## **TYPE 10: Prepositional Connectors**

When two subjects (S1 and S2) are joined by additive words/phrases, the verb agrees with **Subject 1**.

### **Connector List:**
*   With / Along with / Together with
*   As well as / And not
*   In addition to / Besides
*   Like / Unlike / Accompanied by
*   Nothing but / Except / Rather than

### **Rule:**
> **Subject 1 + Connector + Subject 2 + Verb (Matches Subject 1)**

### **Examples:**
1.  **The PM** (S1) along with his colleagues **has** been welcomed. *(S1 is Singular)*
2.  **Veena** (S1) and not her friends **has** won the prize. *(S1 is Singular)*
3.  **You** (S1) and not she **are** accountable for your failure. *(S1 is You)*
4.  **Silver** (S1) as well as gold **is** considered precious metals. *(S1 is Uncountable)*
5.  **The teacher** (S1) as well as students **has** gone on an excursion.
6.  **Grandfather** (S1) along with the children **has** gone to Chennai.
7.  **The leader** (S1) with all his followers **is** sent to prison.

## TYPE 11: Correlative Conjunctions (The Nearest Subject Rule)

Unlike Type 10 (where we look at the *first* subject), when nouns or pronouns are joined by these specific pairs, the verb agrees with the **nearest subject**.

### The Connector List
- **Either … or**
- **Neither … nor**
- **Not only … but also**
- **None … but**
- **Nor**
- **Or**

### The Rule
> **The verb agrees with the subject closest to it (usually Subject 2).**

- **Structure:** Subject 1 + (Connector) + Subject 2 + Verb  
- If Subject 2 is **singular** → use a **singular verb**  
- If Subject 2 is **plural** → use a **plural verb**

### Class Examples

1. **Not only** the PM (S1) **but also** his **ministers** (S2) **are** responsible for the current ambience in India.  
   **Reason:** The verb is closest to *ministers* (plural) → **are**

2. **Neither** the mouse (S1) **nor** the **lion** (S2) **was** caught.  
   **Reason:** The verb is closest to *lion* (singular) → **was**

3. **Neither** the girl (S1) **nor** her **parents** (S2) **were** present to receive the award.  
   **Reason:** The verb is closest to *parents* (plural) → **were**

4. **Electronic mail** (S1) **or** **e-mail** (S2) **is** a method of exchanging digital messages.  
   **Reason:** The verb is closest to *e-mail* (singular) → **is**

## **TYPE 12: Deceptive Nouns**

Certain nouns look plural (end in 's') but are actually **Singular** Proper Nouns (Names of books, games, countries, etc.).

### **Categories & Examples:**
*   **Books:**
    *   **The Arabian Nights is** indeed an interesting book.
    *   **A Tale of Two Cities was** written by Charles Dickens.
*   **Games:**
    *   **Billiards was** being played by Amit and Sumit.
*   **Movies:**
    *   **Three Idiots is** very interesting.
*   **Countries:**
    *   **The United States does** not want India in the security council.

## **TYPE 13: Concept of Percent (Introduction)**

Using the "Pie Chart Method," the teacher explained that taking a percentage of an uncountable noun results in an uncountable amount.

### **The Rule:**
> **Percentage + OF + Uncountable Noun $\rightarrow$ Singular Verb**

### **Logic (Video 60:00+):**
If you have a circle of water (100%) and you take out 25% or 10%, the extracted portion is still **water** (Uncountable). Uncountable nouns always take singular verbs.

### **Handwritten Examples:**
1.  **Twenty five percent of the water has** been used.
2.  **Ten percent of the water has** been used.
    *   *(Note: Even if the percentage changes, the nature of the noun 'water' remains singular/uncountable).*
